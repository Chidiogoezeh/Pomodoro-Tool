# Pomodoro-Tool
A timer app that helps keep track of time and maintain workflow.
Here I am attempting to create my first 'everything' as a web developer. The pomodoro app was recommended by a friend to serve as a tool to help in time management as a programmer, hence the reason of my attempting to create or try and put into practice what I may know with regards software development using python and to work on a much needed improvement in my software development journey.
