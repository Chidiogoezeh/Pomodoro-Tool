# write a python program to calculate the length of the string "Twitter"
my_string = "Twitter"
string_length = len(my_string)
print(f"The length of the string'{my_string}' is: {string_length}")

#these steps could make the code more flexible
#wrap the code in a function first
def twitter_counter():
    my_string = "Twitter"
    string_length = len(my_string)
print(f"The length of the string'{my_string}' is: {string_length}")
twitter_counter()
# Here the code run just fine like the first code but you can now call a function called twitter_counter to do the job.
#there is still a limitation, twitter is not the only word in the world right. so we have to develop it further.

##case 3 making the function even more flexible. 
#add the word as a argument in the function 
def word_counter(word):
    my_string = word
    string_length = len(my_string)
    print(f"The length of the string'{my_string}' is: {string_length}")
word_counter("Python do dey make me mad sha")

#This solution seems more flexible than solution 1 and 2. 
#Also you could call the function with the word. eg word_counter("Nathaniel"), word_counter("Chidiogo"), word_counter("Python do dey make me mad sha")
